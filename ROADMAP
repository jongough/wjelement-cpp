Wjelement-cpp Roadmap
=====================

* add auto conf/make or cmake files for linux
* doxygenize source
* create basic usage html page
* WJPP::Node's JSON schema validators should not throw; instead they should populate a json array with errors
* WJPP::Cache is currently wrong as it should be client specific, i.e. one internal cache
  to store schemas and client caches to store json documents
* The Cache will require mutex protection when manipulating the schema cache
* Support for JSON hyper schema
* Encapsulate JSON schema version specific code so the library can support multiple versions concurrently coexist
