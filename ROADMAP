Wjelement-cpp Roadmap
=====================

* WJElement has some substantial flaws and I'm contemplating replacing it with a lex/yacc parser
  with proper error handling
* Support for JSON hyper schema
* Encapsulate JSON schema version specific code so the library can support multiple JSON
  Schema versions (currently only supports 04)
